                                  REQUIREMENTS

You will need the python widget library urwid. On Debian-based systems this is
available in the following package:

* python-urwid (>= 0.9.8.1)

                                  INSTALLATION

Just type "make install". This will install all the necessary files in the
/usr/share directory. Other directories can be specified by calling make with
the prefix variable, for example, "make prefix=/opt install".

# vi:textwidth=80:expandtab
