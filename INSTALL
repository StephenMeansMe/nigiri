                                  REQUIREMENTS

You will need the Urwid Python module.
On Debian-based systems this is available in the following package:

* python-urwid (>= 0.9.8)

                                  INSTALLATION

Just type "make install". This will install all the necessary files in your home
directory. Other directories can be specified by calling make with the prefix
variable, for example, "make prefix=/usr install".

# vi:textwidth=80:expandtab
