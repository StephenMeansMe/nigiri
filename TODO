- colors (%Cn,m)
- would be nice to support libcontrast but:
  * high color setting is not reliable
  * can't determine background color if not set by self
  * two systems (high and low color)
- implement more commands
  * away
  * back
  * topic
  * ctcp
  * notice
  * invite
  * list
  * kick
  * log
  * oper
  * raw
  * who
  * whois
- overhaul connection management
- implement more signals
  * error
  * shutdown
  * user_away
  * away_message
  * list?
  * banlist
